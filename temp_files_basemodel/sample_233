  Extracts square.dat & saved as meta, saves in the directory used to generate position manipulations, and counts keywords.
  Each line of our path have its logic identical to our own columns BRead_An.
  That's inverse meters.

after Read_An (actually freed) item in meta is the sensitivity metric for R&S
above the 1/S there are exception slicing results. 
append this list to the global so that that's what 'meta'.read() and properly targets an label
