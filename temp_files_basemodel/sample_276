# Write a python function to find the sum of squares of first n even natural numbers.

 In case of codes such as
        #  ( 'Qads Quzel Position' in triangle of vertex, wait_function holds_n_dbens is velocity)
        # rows combo up the fleet matrix for looping...
        for rows_n_vertex in res.vertex_data['normalized_vertices']:
          s_sum = sum(row['sqs'] for row in vertices)
          self.assertGreaterEqual(s_sum, cols_n_vertices)
          self.assertGreaterEqual(s_sum, rows_n_vertex)
