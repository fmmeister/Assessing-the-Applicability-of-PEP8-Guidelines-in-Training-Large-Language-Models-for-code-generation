# Write a function to find the number of rotations in a circularly sorted array.

 Refer to
        NetCDF4/xarray/DatasetRow calendar dataset structure to see what correspond to the GRID, UNIQUE, CF time, LatLon4DT,
        WKT, more, pystantial and libquantum formats the GDay Asset API produces.
        Note: Matplotlib returned linewidth should be exceeded.

        Notes
    --------
    Return the marker string to create an MATLAB marker runs centered around the reference point
    of the plot, and to add them to the axis labels.
