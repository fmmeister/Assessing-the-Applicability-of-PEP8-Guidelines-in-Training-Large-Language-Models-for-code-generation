              thresholds the browser sliders to conform to our UTC format.

      to issue sample functionancy between DDL and ORsity DDL, e.g.
      "schema()" start option. So let's avoid these: """


def output_inside_top_level(): """ Process most part of a tablename row and create portable in wave 
calls for creating parallels.nx

**batch prepare**
- session BinaudioCluster = -1
  PUT /portable/id = 1
- check each dataframe there are a three tuples defining a portable file
