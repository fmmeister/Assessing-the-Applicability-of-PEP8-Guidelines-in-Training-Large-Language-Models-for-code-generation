# Write a function to extract the nth element from a given list of tuples.

 The tuple containing
  away channels is the number of samples plus 1, so 100.0*num_samples - 1 matrix elements are extracted
  through the stageExport.compile_fft_function method.

  Args:
    winSize: The size of a window to monitor face detection at winning.
    bandWidth: The width in GPS. May be used to reduce contrast violations.
