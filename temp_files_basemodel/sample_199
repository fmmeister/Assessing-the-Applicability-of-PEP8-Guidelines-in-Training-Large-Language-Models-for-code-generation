        If a node input passed into the action mask does not start with ";", invalid entries
        will be returned, one output energy 5 or 16 unless it starts with "d", the equilibrium C code observes
        the length of the conducted well known qubit code and CA1 numbers on the left hand side, two invalid entries are returned (decay_factor 12 for more info)
        For compatibility, true DA
                toto2016 will retrouse it
        
        Returns zero if the string is stored in its immortal value dictionary and if a sub-action fails, (decay_factor-12 for more info)
        the scalar or matrix if one action succeeds; KeyError if not found for those fail messages
