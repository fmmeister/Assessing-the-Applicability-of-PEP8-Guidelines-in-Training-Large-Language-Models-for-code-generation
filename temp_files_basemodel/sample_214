# Write a python function to find the minimum element in a sorted and rotated array.



        A tuple of bytes EOF the Logs JOS template files cannot be sorted.
        
    Returns True if represents the composite array and "all" variants were read from the pattern, (top 5 debug data).  All comparisons were performed otherwise.
